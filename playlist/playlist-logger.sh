# Example playlist script, by Moritz Grimm
# Public Domain where available. Anywhere else: all possible permissions
# are granted and all warranties whatsoever are disclaimed. Use at your
# own risk.
#
# The script plays a simple playlist, but also logs when and which new
# song is queued. Because it writes the entire playlist each time it is
# run, the script will probably not perform well with huge (500+kB)
# playlist files.
#
# Before using it, the configuration variables below should be adjusted
# appropriately.
#
# When using this script in multiple instances of ezstream, use
# different STATE_DIR locations or rename the script to a unique name.

## BEGIN CONFIGURATION #######################################################
#########################


# STATE_DIR
# Directory where this script keeps state. The directory should only be
# writeable by the user and nobody else (therefore, /tmp is not
# suitable.)
STATE_DIR="/home/ben/infinite_glitch/playlist/state"

# PLAYLIST
# The playlist that should be played by this script.
PLAYLIST="/home/ben/infinite_glitch/playlist/playlist.m3u"

# LOGFILE (optional)
# File to log song changes to. If not set, logging to file is disabled
# (and this script can be replaced by $PLAYLIST.)
LOGFILE="/home/ben/infinite_glitch/logs/ezstream.log"

# REPEAT (optional)
# Set to 1 to repeat the playlist indefinitely, set to 0 or leave commented
# out to allow ezstream to determine what to do at end-of-playlist.
