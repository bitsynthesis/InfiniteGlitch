INFINITE GLITCH

::Abstract::

An automatically generated, never-repeating, abstract glitch video constructed from the mass of new media uploaded to the web every day. Source audio, images, and video will be ripped daily from a variety of media hosting sites and then combined using collage and glitch techniques to create an organic, ever-changing stream of media. Only free and open source software will be used.

The stream will play 24/7 for 1 year on a public website.

::Structure::

There are 4 main elements: collectors, constructors, converter, streamer.
